# A Docker Jenkins instance with extra dependencies

This is a [Docker](http://www.docker.io) image containing Jenkins along with
its dependencies, and some extra packages that make it easier to deploy
jenkins ready for testing our applications. It's based on
[Phusion Baseimage](http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker) to support
running multiple services in a single container.
